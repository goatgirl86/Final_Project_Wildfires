## Project Overview

### Purpose
**Why Analyze Natural Disasters?**  *Natural disasters affect us all!*
- Goals
    - Understand how the number, type, intensity and distribution of natural disasters has changed over time
    - Use that knowledge to predict the impact of natural disasters in the future.
- Hope / Vision
    - Use natural disaster models to motivate people to take take action by minimizing their contributions to anthropogenic (man-made) climate change.

### Source Data 
- **All Natural Disasters 1900-2021 / EOSDIS** *(from kaggle)*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/all-natural-disasters-19002021-eosdis?q=global+climate+change+in%3Adatasets
- **Questions We Hope to Answer**
    - Has the number of Natural Disasters per year changed over time?
    - Has the types of Natural Disasters changed over time?
    - Has the distribution of Natural Disasters changed over time?
    - Has the intensity of Natural Disasters changed over time?
    - Has the number of people affected by Natural Disasters changed over time?
    - Can future Natural Disasters (number, type, distribution, and intensity) be predicted using the data analyzed?
    - Can this data be combined with annual temperatures to determine a correlation between temperature and natural disasters?

### Technologies, Languages, Tools, and Algorithms Used
- GitHub
- GitMind
- Html
- Google Colaboratory
- Google Slides
- Pandas / Python
- PgAgmin (SQL)
- Tableau

### Communication Plan
Beginning on March 26, 2022, our group held weekly group meetings via Zoom.  In addition, we communicated more regularly using the following communication platforms.  
- Slack
- Google Drive
- Cell Service (Phone/Text)
- Email

## Data Exploration
The "All Natural Disasters 1900-2021" dataset was downloaded from *kaggle* and explored using both Google Colab and Pandas. 
- *Entire Dataset:* 45 columns; 16,127 rows 
  
Based on the data, it was determined that the data needed to be cleaned of columns and rows with large numbers of empty data cells. After cleaning, the dataset included the following columns and rows from which subsequent data analysis was performed.  
- *Data Analyzed* 
    - Columns (9): Year, Disaster Group, Disaster Subgroup, Disaster Type, Disaster Subtype, Country, Continent, Total Deaths, Total Affected
    - Rows: 11,617
