## Project Overview
### Purpose
**Why Study Wildfires?**  *Wildfires affect us all!*
- Wildfires have the potential to harm property, livelihoods, and human health. 
- Multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area.

- Colorado Stats *(from Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control: https://dfpc.colorado.gov/wildfire-information-center/historical-wildfire-information)*
    - 4 of the 5 largest CO wildfires have occured since 2018
    - 20 of the top 20 largest CO wildfires have occured in the last 20 years

### Source Data 
- **U.S. Wildfire data (plus other attributes)** (*https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/capcloudcoder/us-wildfire-data-plus-other-attributes*) 

### Questions to Investigate
-   Has the number of wildfires changed over time?
-   Has the size of wildfires changed over time?
-   Has the cause of wildfires changed over time?
-   Has the timing (month) of wildfires changed over time?
-   How does vegetation type impact the probability of ignition?
-   How do temperature, wind, humidity, precipitation impact the probability of ignition?
-   Does “remoteness” have an impact on wildfire ignition?


### Technologies, Languages, Tools, and Algorithms Used
- GitHub
- GitMind (ERD creation)
- Html
- Google Slides
- Pandas / Python
- PgAgmin (PostgreSQL)
- Tableau
- VSCode

### Communication Plan
Beginning on March 26, 2022, the group held weekly meetings via Zoom in addition to more frequent communication via the following platforms. Each group member actively participated in meetings, contributed to group discussions, sought to help other group members who were stuck or struggling, and played to their personal coding strengths to make the final product the best it could be.

*Communication Platforms utilized for group discussions*
- GitHub
- Google Drive
- Slack
- Zoom

## Data Exploration & Analysis Process
### Data Exploration
The "U.S. Wildfire data (plus other attributes)" dataset was downloaded from *kaggle* and explored using both Google Colab and Pandas. 
- *Entire Dataset:* 43 columns; 55,368 rows 
  
Based on the data, it was determined that the data needed to be cleaned of columns and rows dominated by large numbers of empty cells and zeros. After cleaning, the dataset included the following columns and rows from which the database was created and subsequent data analyses were performed.  
- *Data Analyzed* 
    - Columns: 27 
    - Rows: 13,752
